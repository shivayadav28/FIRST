SQL Datatypes

Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.

In SQL we must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. 
The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column,and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

Data types mainly classified into three categories for every database.

String Data types
Numeric Data types
Date and time Data types


String Data types:
CHAR(Size) - It is used to specify a fixed length string that can contain numbers, letters, and special characters.
Its size can be 0 to 255 characters. Default is 1.

VARCHAR(Size) - It is used to specify a variable length string that can contain numbers, letters, and special characters. 
Its size can be from 0 to 65535 characters. 

TEXT has 4 different types 
1. TINYTEXT
2. TEXT
3. MEDIUM TEXT
4. LONGTEXT

TINYTEXT - It holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters. ex:- Storing Short Descriptions or Tags

TEXT - It holds a string with a maximum length of 65535

MEDIUMTEXT - It holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215. (around 16 million)

LONGTEXT - It holds a string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters. (around 4 billion)

Numeric Data Types:
BIT(Size) - It is used for a bit-value type. The number of bits per value is specified in size. 
Its size can be 1 to 64. The default value is 1.

INT(size) - It is used for the integer value. Its signed range varies from -2147483648 to 2147483647 and unsigned range varies from 0 to 4294967295.
The size parameter specifies the max display width that is 255.

INTEGER(size) - It is equal to INT(size).

BOOL - It is used to specify Boolean values true and false.
Zero is considered as false, and nonzero values are considered as true.

Date and time Data types:
DATE - It is used to specify date format YYYY-MM-DD. 

DATETIME - It is used to specify date and time combination. Its format is YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.

TIMESTAMP - It is used to specify the timestamp. Its value is stored as the number of seconds. Its format is YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.

TIME - It is used to specify the time format. Its format is hh:mm:ss.
